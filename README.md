# jira-details-action

> A lightweight solution to integrate GitHub with Jira for project management. ðŸ”Ž

This action is originally forked from https://github.com/cakeinpanic/jira-description-action, but adds some functionality and removes some. It is by no means a judgment on the nice work of [cakeinpanic](https://github.com/cakeinpanic) - just something that better fits our use cases at [ENPICOM](https://www.enpicom.com).

Tokens are private, so you should add them as [GitHub secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).

### `jira-token`

The Jira token is used to fetch issue information via the Jira REST API. To get the token:-
1. Generate an [API token via JIRA](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html)
2. Add value `<jira username>:<jira api token>` to the `JIRA_TOKEN` secret in your GitHub project.
   For example, if the username is `ci@example.com` and the token is `954c38744be9407ab6fb`, then `ci@example.com:954c38744be9407ab6fb` needs to be added as a secret. You might also decide to encode it as a base64 string yourself: in that case set the `encode-jira-token` input to `true`.

Note: The user should have the [required permissions (mentioned under GET Issue)](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/?utm_source=%2Fcloud%2Fjira%2Fplatform%2Frest%2F&utm_medium=302#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-get).

### Skipping branches

`skip-branches` must be a regex which will work for all sets of branches you want to ignore. This is useful for merging protected/default branches into other branches. Check out some examples in the tests in the repo.

`jira-details-action` already skips PRs which are filed by [dependabot](https://github.com/marketplace/dependabot-preview)

### Searching in branch name/PR title

By default issue key is searched in the PR title (which can easily be changed). `use-branch-name` option can be set to true if you want to get issue key from the branch name .

### Jira issue discovery
The action will discover Jira issues using the following pattern: 
```/([A-Z0-9]{1,10})[ -](\d+)/g```

For example, a PR with title `PROJ 23 Add i18n support. Also fix PROJ-31 and CUST-42` will yield these three JIRA issues: `PROJ-23`, `PROJ-31` and `CUST-42`.
